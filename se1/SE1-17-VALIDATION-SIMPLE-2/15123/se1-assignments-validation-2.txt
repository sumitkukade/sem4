 [
 write a program to validate the student project group information as discussed in the class
 to check the rules
  - maximum 3 group members
  - everybody should be a member of exactly one group
  - all members of a group should agree to make the group valid 
  - a student can send multiple submissions [e.g. to correct errors in the previous mails, or just by mistake]; any one of these submissions is sufficient if found valid

 ]
 your program should take input from a single file and output should be written to a file [name of the input/output files should be taken as cmd line parameters]

see the sample input files [groups01*.txt] in the repo.

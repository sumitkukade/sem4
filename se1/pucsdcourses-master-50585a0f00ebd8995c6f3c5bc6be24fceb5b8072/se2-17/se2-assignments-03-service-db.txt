[assignment text - [

write a schema for the msg-db

relations/tables outline
 - users  - sysuserid, userid, username, dob, email
 - groups - sysgroupid, groupid, groupname
 - members - memberid
 - groupMembers - groupid, memberid, accessRight
 - accessRights - accessRight, accessRightDescriptions
 - msgSourceStore - sysuserid, msgid, msgtext, msgTimestamp, draftOrSent, 
 - msgSinkStore - memberid, msgid, msgtext, msgTimestamp
 - msgAttachments - msgid, atchid, atchname, atchblob
 - memberLabels - memberid, label, labelDescription
 - memberLabelGroups - memberid, label, parentLabel
 - memberMsgLabels - memberid, msgid, label

you should add fields/tables that you think are required for the system to support sending/receiving of messages from users to users/groups .
note that the system is bunch of services working async.

you should think as to how the functionalities like moderation/upvote/downvote etc can be added, but this is not strictly required.

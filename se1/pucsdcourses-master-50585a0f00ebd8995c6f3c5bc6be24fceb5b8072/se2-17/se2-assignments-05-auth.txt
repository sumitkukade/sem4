[assignment text - [

implment a better and more sophisticated authentication support for your web app using apache mod_auth_tkt. understand that this module is language independent, so you can/must integrate it with your login/password code. note that this uses cookies, but that won't be an issue for us, as we will not support any browsers without cookie support. 

i'll discuss this in the class. 

during the eval, [which you will have to give after the deadline as per the schedule to be announced yet], you should be able to demonstrate the working auth system, based on the following -
 - mod_auth_tkt
 - sqlite3/postgres db for username/password storage
 - your auth app that will talk with mod_auth_tkt
 - with other messaging components, if any, [for bonus credit]

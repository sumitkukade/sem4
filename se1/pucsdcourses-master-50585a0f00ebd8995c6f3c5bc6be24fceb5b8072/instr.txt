instructions - se1/se2 

deadline - 21/01/2017

every group should set up a gitlab account.

create a private repo of your project and 
add me to your group and grant read/write access to your repo.

the repo should be named se2-17/se1-17 as the case may be, after that subdirectories 
may be created as per assignments.

after this i will accept submissions only through git via gitlab.

[note] - but as the gitlab server may be down sometimes, 
         you should also submit on gmail as specified in the assignment text.
         but note that i will check gmail, only if gitlab is not available 
         for a very long time [e.g. > 12hr]

[about .gitignore]
 you should avoid pushing unnecessary files [e.g. binary files that are generated by compiler/linker etc] according to your project.
 you can use .gitignore file to achieve this.
